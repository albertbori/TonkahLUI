	2 - WHen recreating enUS.lua create a hash table so that you have
	["Red Aura"] = 66602, as well as [66602,0 = "Red Aura"
	- #10 working translator
	this needs some improvements but it works
	- #10 need to sort out this function function GSTRGetConditionalsFromString(str)
	local leftstr = string.find("str", "/\[/g")
	local rightstr = string.find("str", "/\]/g")
	- more for #10 Its "this much" away
	almost there
	- Debugging and code checks for #19
	- next attempt of a translator for #10
	The original approach was too intensive  It started with the list of
	words and tried a straight regex find replace.  This will work but
	extracting the list of spells and cleaning it up will be annoying.
	
	The new approach to use GSTranslateString instead iterates over the
	words of the macro instead.
	- #10 Cutting some abilities out
	- Bug fix for #10 esMX
	- Local Extractor for #10
	The extractor is a stand alone lua file that takes a dump of all the
	spells by id and then removes the duplicates and the nil values.  This
	should need to be run again.
	- more work for #10
	- #10 While this works it takes way too long to log in with.  Need to adjust enUS.lua and esMX.lua but make it a repeatable process.
	- #10 Trying to extract via a text box didnt work.  Instead created a GSE-LanguageExtractor
	- hook #10 to the core
